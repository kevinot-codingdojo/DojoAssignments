2. Change directory to your local directory where you want to create your repository folder:
	a.	C:\WINDOWS\System32>cd\
	b.	C:\>cd..\users\kevin\gittest\

3. Create the folder DojoAssignments, and then navigate to it:
		C:\Users\Kevin\gittest>md DojoAssignments
		C:\Users\Kevin\gittest>cd DojoAssignments

4. Initialize the folder as a Git repository:
		C:\Users\Kevin\gittest\DojoAssignments>git init
			Initialized empty Git repository in C:/Users/Kevin/gittest/DojoAssignments/.git/

5. How are we doing? Check status:
		C:\Users\Kevin\gittest\DojoAssignments>git status
			On branch master

			Initial commit

			nothing to commit (create/copy files and use "git add" to track)

6. Log into github.com, click +v in upper right corner, and select New Repository.

7. Name repository the same as the local repository on my machine, then click green Create repository button at bottom of the page.

8. In resulting page, copy the "git remote add origin ...DojoAssignements.git" command line text. 

9. Return to command prompt, paste the git remote command line, and then press Enter.

10. C:\Users\Kevin\gittest\DojoAssignments>git remote add origin https://github.com/kevinot-codingdojo/DojoAssignments.git

11. Copy next line from GitHub page to command line.

	a. C:\Users\Kevin\gittest\DojoAssignments>git push -u origin master
	
		error: src refspec master does not match any.
		error: failed to push some refs to 'https://github.com/kevinot-codingdojo/DojoAssignments.git'

	Note: In the demo, the instructor had created two files in the repository before creating the remote repository. The Assignment Repo did not specificy that. So I created one file, committed it, and then added it. 

	b. Create a file so folder isn't empty:
		C:\Users\Kevin\gittest\DojoAssignments>copy NUL style.css
			1 file(s) copied.

	c. Check the status:
		C:\Users\Kevin\gittest\DojoAssignments>git status
			On branch master

			Initial commit

			Untracked files:
			(use "git add <file>..." to include in what will be committed)

			style.css

			nothing added to commit but untracked files present (use "git add" to track)

	d. Add the file:
		C:\Users\Kevin\gittest\DojoAssignments>git add *.*

	e. Commit changes to repository, with comment:

			[master (root-commit) 9335b05] added style to repository
			1 file changed, 0 insertions(+), 0 deletions(-)
			create mode 100644 style.css

	f. Check status again:
		C:\Users\Kevin\gittest\DojoAssignments>git status
			On branch master
			nothing to commit, working tree clean
